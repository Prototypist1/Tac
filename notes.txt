How you do a not in tac:

not true then "false" -> ( system . print )

I really need you to not have to put "()" around "." tho. order of operations is probably the best way to make this nice? I mean you could write:

not true then  system . print <- "false" 

I think I am abondoning the all binary operations module. just match whatever.

----------------------

I don't like "this" it confuses the shit out of scott and chris. I think I am more interested in:

enslosing-scope

and

current-scope

maybe with shorter aliases
